This folder, mlpProject, contains data folder for trainning and validation and code folder for source code.

In starterCode, each time you run the train_mlp.py, the program would save a modelFile named in the following format: 
{train file name}_{total epochs}_{learning rate}_{the number of hidden units}

The modelFile is generated using ubuntu OS
